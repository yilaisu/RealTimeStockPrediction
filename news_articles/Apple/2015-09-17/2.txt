On September 10, 2015, Apple Inc. (“Apple”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Goldman, Sachs & Co., as representative of the several underwriters named therein, for the issuance and sale by Apple of €1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Apple’s 1.375% Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), and €1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Apple’s 2.000% Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes,” and, together with the 2024 Notes, the “Notes”).
The Notes are being issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 29, 2013 (the “Indenture”), between Apple and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, together with the officer’s certificate dated as of September 17, 2015 issued pursuant thereto establishing the terms of each series of the Notes (the “Officer’s Certificate”).
The Notes are being issued pursuant to Apple’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2013 (Reg. No. 333-188191) (the “Registration Statement”).
Interest on the 2024 Notes will be payable annually on January 17 of each year, beginning on January 17, 2016 and on the maturity date for the 2024 Notes.
