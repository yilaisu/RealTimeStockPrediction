The Board of Directors shall fix the location of the principal executive office of Apple Inc. (the “Corporation”) at any place within or outside the State of California.

The number of directors of the Corporation shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9). The exact number of directors shall be eight (8) until changed within the limits specified above, by a bylaw amending this Section 2.2, duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the shareholders. The indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a definite number fixed without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly adopted amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by amendment to these Bylaws duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number less than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written consent, are equal to more than sixteen and two-thirds percent (16-2/3%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. No amendment may change the stated maximum number of authorized directors to a number greater than two (2) times the stated minimum number of directors minus one (1).
 
 	2.3	
Compensation

Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services, and may be reimbursed for expenses, as fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. This Section 2.3 shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation for those services.
 
 	2.4	
Election and Term of Office

Each director shall be elected to serve until the annual meeting of shareholders held in the following fiscal year and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term of any incumbent director who fails to be elected by “approval of the shareholders” as defined in Section 153 of the Code in an “Uncontested Election” (as such term is defined below) and who has not earlier resigned will end on the date that is the earlier of: (a) ninety (90) days after the date on which the voting results are determined pursuant to Section 707 of the Code; or (b) the date on which the Board of Directors selects a person to fill the office held by that director in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.5. For purposes of these Bylaws, an “Uncontested Election” means an election of directors in which, at the expiration of the later of the time fixed for nomination of director candidates pursuant to (i) Section 5.14 regarding advance notice and (ii) Section 5.15 regarding proxy access, the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election.

 	2.5	
Vacancies and Resignations

(a)   A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist (i) in the event of the death, resignation or removal of any director, (ii) if the authorized number of directors is increased, (iii) if the shareholders fail, at any meeting of shareholders at which any director or directors are elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be elected at that meeting, (iv) if the Board of Directors declares vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony, or (v) at the end of the term of an incumbent director who fails to be elected by approval of the shareholders as set forth in Section 2.4.
(b)   Except for a vacancy caused by the removal of a director as provided in Section 2.7, a vacancy may be filled by a person selected by a majority of the remaining directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Vacancies created by the removal of a director shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of shares holding a majority of the voting power represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the voting power required to constitute a quorum), or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon.
(c)   The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a vacancy or vacancies not filled by the directors, but any such election by written consent, other than to fill a vacancy created by removal, shall require the consent of shares holding a majority of the voting power that are entitled to vote thereon. A director may not be elected by written consent to fill a vacancy created by removal except by unanimous consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.
(d)   Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the General Counsel and Secretary of the Corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the Board of Directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective. A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove any director prior to the expiration of such director’s term of office.

 	2.6	
Chairman of the Board and Lead Directors

The Corporation may have at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a Chairman of the Board of Directors and/or one or more Lead Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, if there is one, or a Lead Director, shall have the power to preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and shall have such other powers and shall be subject to such other duties as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe or as may be prescribed by these Bylaws. If there is more than one Lead Director, the Board of Directors may prescribe different responsibilities to each Lead Director.
 
 	2.7	
Removal

The entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without regard to whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number of directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then being elected. If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or series of shares is entitled to elect one or more directors under authority granted by the Articles of Incorporation, the provisions of this Section 2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

Written notice shall be given by the Corporation to any shareholder, either (a) personally or (b) by mail or other means of written communication (including electronic transmission by the Corporation), charges prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder’s physical or electronic address appearing on the books of the Corporation or given by such shareholder to the Corporation for the purpose of notice. If a shareholder gives no address or no such address appears on the books of the Corporation, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent by mail or other means of written communication addressed to the place where the principal executive office of the Corporation is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which such office is located. The notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means of written communication and addressed as hereinbefore provided. An affidavit of delivery or mailing, or other authorized means of transmitting, of any notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.5, executed by the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice. If any notice addressed to the shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of the Corporation is returned to the Corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the shareholder at such address, all future notices shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the shareholder upon written demand of the shareholder at the principal executive office of the Corporation for a period of one (1) year from the date of the giving of the notice to all other shareholders. Notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the Corporation after either one of the following: (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver two (2) consecutive notices to the shareholder by that means or (ii) the inability to so deliver such notices to the shareholder becomes known to the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of the notice.
 
14
 	5.6	
Consent to Shareholders’ Meetings

The transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as to approval of contracts between the Corporation and any of its directors, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of the Corporation or winding up the affairs of the Corporation.
 
 	5.7	
Quorum

The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such shares at the meeting has been enjoined or if for any reason they cannot be lawfully voted at the meeting. The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
 
15
 	5.8	
Adjourned Meetings

Any shareholders’ meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section 5.7, in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such meeting. When any meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if its time and place (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the Corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which the shareholders may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. When a meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five (45) days or if after adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting. At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact any business which might have been properly transacted at the original meeting.
 
 	5.9	
Record Date for Shareholder Notice; Voting; Giving Consents

(a)   In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any other action. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of shareholders, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or the Code. In the absence of any contrary provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in any applicable statute relating to the election of directors or to other particular matters, each such person shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share.
 
16
(b)   A determination of the shareholders of record entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five (45) days from the date set for the original meeting.

 	5.10	
Action by Written Consent

(a)   Any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
(b)   If the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have not been solicited in writing, the Secretary shall give prompt notice of any corporate action approved by the shareholders without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent to those shareholders entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. Such notice shall be given in the manner specified in Section 5.5 and applicable law.

(d)   Any shareholder giving a written consent, or the shareholder’s proxy holder, or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder or their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received by the Corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary, but may not do so thereafter. Such revocation is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary.
(e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors; provided that the shareholders may elect a director to fill a vacancy not filled by the Board of Directors, other than a vacancy created by removal, by the written consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
 
 	5.11	
Election of Directors

“Approval of the shareholders” (as defined in Section 153 of the Code) is required to elect a director in any Uncontested Election of directors. In any other election of directors by the shareholders, the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect. Elections of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.
 
18
 	5.12	
Proxies

(a)   Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person’s duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary. No proxy shall be valid (i) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 5.12 and applicable law, or (ii) after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such proxy is to continue in force. Revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy. A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, a written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the Corporation.
(b)   A proxy which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified therein when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the following: (i) a pledgee, (ii) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of such person’s shares in the Corporation to the maker of the proxy, (iii) a creditor or creditors of the Corporation or the shareholder who extended or continued credit to the Corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing the credit, (iv) a person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of the Corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the period of employment contracted for, or (v) a person designated by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust agreement. In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the obligation secured by it.
 
19
(c)   Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of the Corporation or dies, the debt of the Corporation or the shareholder is paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares or, in the case of uncertificated shares, on the initial transaction statement and written statements.
(d)   Every form of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate space marked “abstain,” whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her shares on the proposal. A proxy marked “abstain” by the shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for or against such proposal. In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a shareholder “withhold” or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.
 
 	5.13	
Inspectors of Elections

Before any meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the Chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder’s proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a shareholder’s proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy. These inspectors shall:
(a)   determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
 
20
(b)   receive votes, ballots, or consents;
(c)   hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
(d)   count and tabulate all votes or consents;

To be timely, a shareholder’s notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting nor later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day of such anniversary date (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made by the Corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of shareholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder’s notice as described above. To be in proper written form, a shareholder’s notice to the Secretary (whether pursuant to this Section 5.14(a)(ii) or Section 5.14(b) and other than a nomination for director pursuant to Section 5.15) must set forth:
(1)   as to each person, if any, whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act and (B) such person’s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected;
(2)   if the notice relates to any business (other than the nomination of persons for election as directors) that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, (B) the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), (C) the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and (D) any material interest in such business of such shareholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
 
22
(3)   as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Corporation’s books, and of such beneficial owner, (B) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and by such beneficial owner, (C) any derivative positions with respect to shares of capital stock of the Corporation held or beneficially held by or on behalf of such shareholder and by or on behalf of such beneficial owner, the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into with respect to the shares of capital stock of the Corporation by or on behalf of such shareholder and by or on behalf of such beneficial owner, and the extent to which any other agreement, arrangement or understanding has been made, the effect or intent of which is to increase or decrease the voting power of such shareholder and such beneficial owner with respect to shares of capital stock of the Corporation, (D) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (E) a representation whether the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends (aa) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation’s outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee or (bb) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such proposal or nomination.
The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine (x) the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation, and (y) whether such nominee qualifies as an “independent director” or “audit committee financial expert” for purposes of membership of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof under applicable law, the rules of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the shares of the Corporation are listed, or any publicly-disclosed corporate governance guidelines or committee charter of the Corporation.
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5.14 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, a shareholder’s notice required by this Section 5.14 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
 
23
(b)   Special Meetings of Shareholders.
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation’s notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation’s notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the Corporation who is a shareholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 5.14 is delivered to the Secretary, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election, and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5.14. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such shareholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation’s notice of meeting, if the shareholder’s notice in the same form as required by paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5.14 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a shareholder’s notice as described above.
 
24
(c)   General.
(i) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.14 (in the case of an annual or special meeting) or in Section 5.15 (in the case of an annual meeting only) shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.14.

For purposes of this Section 5.14, to be considered a qualified representative of the shareholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such shareholder to act for such shareholder as proxy at the meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of shareholders.

(ii) At the request of the Corporation, the Shareholder Nominee must promptly, but in any event within five (5) business days after such request, submit all completed and signed questionnaires required of the Corporation’s directors and provide to the Corporation such other information as it may reasonably request. The Corporation may request such additional information as necessary to permit the Corporation to determine if each Shareholder Nominee satisfies this Section 5.15.
(i)   Shareholder Nominees.
(i) The maximum number of Shareholder Nominees that may be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 5.15 shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Shareholder Notice may be delivered pursuant to this Section 5.15 with respect to the annual meeting of shareholders, or if such calculation does not result in a whole number, the closest whole number below twenty percent (20%); provided, however, that this maximum number shall be reduced, but not below zero (0), by the number of (1) Shareholder Nominees whose name was submitted for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 5.15 but either is subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as a Board nominee, (2) directors in office who had been a Shareholder Nominee at any of the preceding two (2) annual meetings of shareholders and whose reelection at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders is being recommended by the Board of Directors, (3) director candidates for which the Corporation shall have received one or more valid shareholder notices (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) nominating director candidates pursuant to Section 5.14, and (4) directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the Corporation) nominee pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or other understanding with any shareholder or group of shareholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of shares of capital stock of the Corporation, by such shareholder or group of shareholders, from the Corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (4) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least two (2) annual terms.
 
32
(ii) In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs after the deadline in Section 5.15(f) for delivery of the Shareholder Notice but before the annual meeting of shareholders and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the maximum number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced.
(iii) In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 5.15 exceeds the maximum number set forth in the foregoing, the Corporation shall determine which Shareholder Nominees shall be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials in accordance with the following provisions: each Eligible Shareholder (or in the case of a group, each group constituting an Eligible Shareholder) will select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Corporation each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as Owned in its respective Shareholder Notice submitted to the Corporation. If the maximum number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder (or in the case of a group, each group constituting an Eligible Shareholder) has selected one Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum number is reached.
(iv) Following the determination of which Shareholder Nominees shall be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials, if any Shareholder Nominee who satisfies the eligibility requirements in this Section 5.15 is thereafter nominated by the Board of Directors, thereafter is otherwise not included in the Corporation’s proxy materials or thereafter is not submitted for director election for any reason (including the Eligible Shareholder’s or Shareholder Nominee’s failure to comply with this Section 5.15), no other nominee or nominees shall be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials or otherwise submitted for director election in substitution thereof.
 
33
(v) Any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation’s proxy materials for a particular annual meeting of shareholders but either (1) withdraws from or becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the annual meeting of shareholders for any reason, including for the failure to comply with any provision of these Bylaws; provided that in no event shall any such withdrawal, ineligibility or unavailability commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Shareholder Notice, or (2) does not receive a number of votes cast in favor of his or her election at least equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote in the election of directors, will be ineligible to be a Shareholder Nominee pursuant to this Section 5.15 for the next two (2) annual meetings of shareholders.
(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.15, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any Shareholder Nominee, and such nomination shall be disregarded and no vote on such Shareholder Nominee will occur, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation, if:
(1)   (A) the Eligible Shareholder (or any member of any group of shareholders that together is such Eligible Shareholder) or Shareholder Nominee breaches any of its respective agreements, representations, or warranties set forth in the Shareholder Notice (or that are otherwise submitted pursuant to this Section 5.15), (B) any of the information in the Shareholder Notice (or that is otherwise submitted pursuant to this Section 5.15) was not, when provided, true, correct and complete, or (C) the requirements of this Section 5.15 have otherwise not been met;
 
34
(2)   the Shareholder Nominee (A) is not an “independent director” for purposes of membership of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof under applicable law, the rules of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the shares of the Corporation are listed, or any publicly-disclosed corporate governance guidelines or committee charter of the Corporation, (B) does not qualify, as a “non-employee director” under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3, or as an “outside director” for the purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (or any successor provision), (C) is or has been, within the past three (3) years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended, (D) is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in a criminal proceeding within the past ten (10) years, or (E) is subject to any order of the type specified in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; or
(3)   the election of the Shareholder Nominee to the Board of Directors would cause the Corporation to be in violation of the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, any applicable state or federal law, rule, or regulation or any applicable listing standard.
(j)   Additional Provisions.
(i) The Board of Directors (and any other person or body authorized by the Board of Directors) shall have the power and authority to interpret this Section 5.15 and to make any and all determinations necessary or advisable to apply this Section 5.15 to any persons, facts or circumstances, including the power to determine (1) whether one or more shareholders or beneficial owners qualifies as an Eligible Shareholder, (2) whether a Shareholder Notice complies with this Section 5.15 and has otherwise met the requirements of this Section 5.15, (3) whether a Shareholder Nominee satisfies the qualifications and requirements in this Section 5.15, and (4) whether any and all requirements of this Section 5.15 (or any applicable requirements of Section 5.14) have been satisfied; provided that, if any determination must be made at the annual meeting of shareholders, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and authority to make such determination, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors. Any such interpretation or determination adopted in good faith by the Board of Directors (or any other person or body authorized by the Board of Directors) or the Chairman of the meeting, as the case may be, shall be binding on all persons, including the Corporation and its shareholders (including any beneficial owners).
 
35
(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.15, unless otherwise required by law or otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, if (1) the Eligible Shareholder, or (2) a qualified representative of the Eligible Shareholder does not appear at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to present its Shareholder Nominee or Shareholder Nominees, such nomination or nominations shall be disregarded, and no vote on such Shareholder Nominee or Shareholder Nominees will occur, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 5.15, to be considered a qualified representative of the Eligible Shareholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such Eligible Shareholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such Eligible Shareholder to act for such Eligible Shareholder as proxy at the annual meeting of shareholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the annual meeting of shareholders.
(iii) In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Shareholder or any Shareholder Nominees to the Corporation or its shareholders is not, when provided, or thereafter ceases to be, true, correct and complete in all material respects (including omitting a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading), each Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Secretary and provide the information that is required to make such information or communication true, correct, complete and not misleading; it being understood that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the Corporation’s right to omit a Shareholder Nominee from its proxy materials pursuant to this Section 5.15.
(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.15, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement (or portion thereof) that it, in good faith, believes would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or listing standard. Nothing in this Section 5.15 shall limit the ability of the Corporation to solicit proxies against any Shareholder Nominee or to include in its proxy materials its own statements or any other additional information relating to any Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee.

ARTICLE VII
GENERAL MATTERS
 
 	7.1

For purposes of determining the shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action (other than with respect to notice or voting at a shareholders’ meeting or action by shareholders by written consent without a meeting), the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to any such action. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment or rights, or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided for in the Articles of Incorporation or the Code.
 
 	7.2	
Instruments in Writing

All checks, drafts, other orders for payments of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation, and all written contracts of the Corporation, shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents, as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.

39
 	7.3	
Shares Held by the Corporation

Shares in other corporations standing in the name of the Corporation may be voted or represented and all rights incident thereto may be exercised on behalf of the Corporation by any officer of the Corporation authorized to do so by resolution of the Board of Directors.

 	7.4	
Certificated and Uncertificated Shares

(a)   Certificates for the shares of stock of the Corporation shall be issued only to the extent as may be required by applicable law or as otherwise authorized by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, and if so issued shall be in such form as is consistent with the Articles of Incorporation and applicable law. Any such certificates shall be signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the Chief Executive Officer or the President and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares and the class or series of shares owned by the shareholder. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
(b)   Unless otherwise required by applicable law or authorized by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, shares of the Corporation shall be issued, recorded and transferred exclusively in uncertificated book-entry form in accordance with a direct registration program operated by a clearing agency registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. Shares of the Corporation represented by certificates that were issued prior to November 17, 2010 shall continue to be certificated securities of the Corporation until the certificates therefor have been surrendered to the Corporation.
 
40
 	7.5	
Lost Certificates

Except as provided in this Section 7.5, no new shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent or registrar and cancelled at the same time. When the owner of any certificate for shares of the Corporation claims that the certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, uncertificated shares, in accordance with Section 7.4(b) above, shall be issued in place of the original certificate if the owner (a) so requests before the Corporation has notice that the original certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, (b) files with the Corporation an indemnity bond in such form and in such amount sufficient to protect the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement shares, and (c) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the Corporation. The Board of Directors may adopt such other provisions and restrictions with reference to lost certificates, not inconsistent with applicable law, as it shall in its discretion deem appropriate.

 	10.4	
Indemnification not Exclusive

The indemnification provided by this Article X for acts, omissions or transactions while acting in the capacity of, or while serving as, a director or officer of the Corporation but not involving a breach of duty to the Corporation and its shareholders shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, to the extent the additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the Articles of Incorporation.
 
 	10.5
