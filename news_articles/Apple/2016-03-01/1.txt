The Board of Directors of Apple Inc. previously adopted, subject to shareholder approval, an amendment and restatement of Apple’s 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”).

The foregoing brief description is qualified in its entirety by the text of the 2014 Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
