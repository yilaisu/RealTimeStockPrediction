Technology Briefing | Hardware: Blackberry Maker Sees Lower Sales
Shares in Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of BlackBerry e-mail pagers, fell 13.2 percent yesterday after the company warned that its sales would be lower and its costs higher in its fiscal year 2003. Late Tuesday, the company said that it had cut its first-quarter revenue target to the ''low $70 million range'' from $75 million to $80 million. The company also said it had lost $12.5 million, or 14 cents a share, in its fourth quarter. Analysts expected a loss of 15 cents a share. Although BlackBerry added about 32,000 subscribers during the quarter, the company said, it was hurt when its corporate customers cut their work forces. The BlackBerry devices account for 82 percent of the company's sales. Research in Motion shares ended the day at $20.19, down $3.07. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
