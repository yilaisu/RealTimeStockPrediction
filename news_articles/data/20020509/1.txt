Cultivating BlackBerry As a Hybrid
A COUPLE of years ago I accompanied my wife to a plastic surgeons' convention. There on the exhibition floor, among the booths hawking surgical instruments, implants and sutures, I came upon the strangest sight: a company selling hands. They were absolutely perfect prosthetic hands, staggeringly realistic even to the touch, complete with fingerprints, pores and tiny hairs. The price: $10,000 each. I remember being struck by how differently people might view that price tag. Even though these were surely the world's finest hands, no average consumer would spend ten grand on one. For somebody who actually needed a prosthetic, on the other hand, $10,000 might well seem right on target, or even a bargain.
