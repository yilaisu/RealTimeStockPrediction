Technology Briefing | Hardware: Blackberry Maker Lays Off 10% Of Work Force
Research in Motion Ltd., the Canadian maker of BlackBerry e-mail pagers, said yesterday that it would lay off approximately 10 percent of its work force, or 220 employees, in an effort to reduce expenses. The company will take a charge of $8 million to $9 million in its third quarter, which ends on Nov. 30. ''In order to solidify our position and achieve our financial targets, we are moving ahead with a difficult, yet strategically important, decision to tighten operational efficiencies and adjust our current staffing level,'' said Jim Balsillie, Research's chief executive. Last week the company, based in Waterloo, Ontario, signed three licensing deals, including a widely publicized agreement to license its BlackBerry software to Nokia. That announcement sent Research shares up almost 30 percent. Yesterday, however, Research shares fell $1.02, to $14.60. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
