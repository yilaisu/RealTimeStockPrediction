Patents; The battle over BlackBerry heads to a crucial court date, and a challenge of more patents.
A LITTLE-KNOWN Virginia company fired a new salvo last week in a lawsuit that threatens to take away one of the prized possessions of the technologically astute: the little messaging device known as the BlackBerry. The BlackBerry, produced by Research in Motion Ltd. of Waterloo, Ontario, is one of several hand-held devices on the market that allow a person to send and receive e-mail without being hooked up to a cable or phone line. But it has been praised for being especially nimble and is the device of choice not just among many high-tech business people but also members of Congress and certain Hollywood stars (Matt Damon and Pamela Anderson among them, according to one report).
