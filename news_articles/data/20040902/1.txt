Missing Link for the Mac User Who Craves a BlackBerry
As the BlackBerry wireless e-mail device has grown into a full-fledged computer, it has left Macintosh users behind. The software provided by Research in Motion, BlackBerry's maker, for synchronizing address book and calendar data runs only on Windows-based computers. Now Information Appliance Associates, a company that makes software for linking Macs with PocketPC devices, has a $30 piece of software for Mac users who want to be BlackBerry owners.
