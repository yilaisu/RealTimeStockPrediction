Technology Briefing | Hardware: New Version Of Blackberry Introduced
Research In Motion, which popularized wireless e-mailing with its thumb-operated BlackBerry, introduced a new version of the device yesterday with a smaller, revamped keyboard. The new 20-character keyboard resembles a stretched out telephone keypad combined with the traditional QWERTY keyboard used on the original BlackBerry. The design means most of the keys have more than one letter. To compensate for this, the device includes software to guess which words the user is typing. Research in Motion executives said the latest variation of the phone and messaging device was designed to win over customers more familiar or comfortable with typing on a phone keypad. It will be available to consumers the first week in October. The new BlackBerry 7100t will be available for $199.99 through T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom. Research in Motion plans to offer the device outside the United States but has not yet set up partnerships with overseas phone companies.
