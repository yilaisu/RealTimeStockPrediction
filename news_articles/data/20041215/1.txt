Court Upholds Patent Ruling Against Maker of BlackBerry
A United States appeals court upheld a finding of patent infringement against Research In Motion Ltd. yesterday, but struck down part of the ruling and sent it back to a lower court for further proceedings. Shares of Research In Motion, which makes the BlackBerry data device, soared more than 10 percent on news that a decision had been reached. Those gains were erased after the court released details of the decision. Trading in Research in Motion was then halted, with shares on the Nasdaq closing down $4.65 to $85.44.
