In Suit, BlackBerry Maker Pleads Canadian
Having lost a recent patent case in Virginia, Research in Motion, maker of the popular BlackBerry device, has turned to a peculiar appeal strategy: We're not based in the United States, so you can't touch us. More surprisingly, the Canadian government and the Internet service provider EarthLink are now formally supporting that argument.
Research in Motion, Canada-based maker of BlackBerry device, is appealing US federal court ruling that it infringed patents held by NTP, arguing that software its relay server in Canada uses is beyond reach of American patents, even though over million BlackBerrys are used in United States; Canadian government and Internet service provider EarthLink back argument; NTP patents stem largely from work that late Thomas J Campana Jr did for Telefind, now defunct pager company, that was able to send crude form of e-mail to customers in late 1980's; photos (M)
