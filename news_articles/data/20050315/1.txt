Technology Briefing | Services: Blackberry Introduces New Messaging Options
The BlackBerry maker Research in Motion is broadening its menu of instant-messaging options. New services for the hand-held communications device include instant messaging offerings from Yahoo and the America Online unit of Time Warner, the companies announced yesterday in conjunction with the CTIA Wireless show in New Orleans. Research in Motion also announced software deals with Sybase and High Tech Computer. The BlackBerry will be preloaded with Yahoo's software ''in the coming months,'' the companies said, without being more specific. Yahoo Messenger users will have full wireless access to their contacts and be able to carry on multiple chat sessions. Currently, BlackBerry users can obtain access to Yahoo offerings like search, news and sports updates, depending on availability through phone carriers. Research in Motion is also working with America Online to include AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ services on the BlackBerry, besides offering AOL's mobile mail service. BlackBerry users will get access to their AOL Buddy List feature or ICQ contact list for chatting on both networks. No schedule was given for when the services would be available. Two years ago, AOL ended a deal with Research in Motion in which the two companies offered a co-branded wireless messaging device. Shortly after that, Research in Motion began equipping the BlackBerry with instant-messaging software from I.B.M.'s Lotus division.
