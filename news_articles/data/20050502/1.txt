A Payday for Patents 'R' Us; Huge BlackBerry Settlement Is Grist for Holding Company
The express elevator that whisks visitors to Donald E. Stout's office on the top floor of a black glass building across the Potomac from Washington suggests success. But nothing up there indicates that Mr. Stout is a major player in the software business. There are no cubicles for software engineers or humming server farms capturing their keystrokes. There are, however, plenty of lawyers. Mr. Stout, who has practiced patent law for 33 years, is a founder of NTP, whose only assets are a series of wireless e-mail patents granted to Thomas J. Campana Jr., the other founder, and whose only business is extracting licensing fees from companies.
Interview with Donald E Stout on Research in Motion accord to pay his NTP $450 million to settle long-running and sometimes bitter dispute over wireless e-mail patents granted to late NTP co-founder Thomas J Campana Jr; settlement has emboldened NTP, whose only business is extracting licensing fees from companies, in its pursuit of additional licenses; other companies, including Nokia, have already signed licensing accords; critics of such patent holding companies hold they rely on excessively broad patents, particularly for software, that should never have been granted; costs of patent disputes have become fact of life for technology companies; patnet suit graph; photos (M)
