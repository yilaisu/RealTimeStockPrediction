BlackBerry Ruling Upheld
A federal appeals court upheld most of a ruling that the BlackBerry e-mail pager by Research In Motion infringed patents, but delayed a judge's order that sales of the device in the United States be halted. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington told Judge James R. Spencer of United States District Court in Richmond, Va., yesterday to rewrite a 2002 injunction to reflect decisions made on appeal.
