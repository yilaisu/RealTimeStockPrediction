Nokia, With Sales on Rise, Plans Rival to BlackBerry
Nokia, the leading maker of mobile phones, announced Tuesday that sales were improving and that it was introducing a mobile e-mail product to compete with BlackBerry and others. Nokia's revenue and earnings faltered a year ago when it mismatched its products to the market, but it said sales for the three months that will end Sept. 30 should be 8.4 billion euros ($10.3 billion) to 8.5 billion euros, compared with its previous expectations of 7.9 billion euros to 8.2 billion euros. Nokia predicted earnings of 18 to 19 cents a share, up from an earlier estimate of 14 to 17 cents.
