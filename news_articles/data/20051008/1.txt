Court Ruling in BlackBerry Case Puts Service to U.S. Users at Risk
A court decision Friday renewed the possibility that service to BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices might be cut off for most users in the United States. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington rejected a request by Research in Motion, the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry, to rehear its appeal of a patent infringement case brought by NTP Inc., the patent holder. A three-judge panel of the court ruled in August that Research in Motion had violated seven of NTP's patents.
