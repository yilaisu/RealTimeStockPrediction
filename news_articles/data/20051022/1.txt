Federal Appeals Court Refuses to Impede BlackBerry Lawsuit
A federal court in the United States on Friday refused a request from Research in Motion to freeze a patent infringement lawsuit while it appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington leaves the door open for NTP Inc., a patent holding company, to ask a lower court to impose an injunction granted two years ago against Research in Motion.
