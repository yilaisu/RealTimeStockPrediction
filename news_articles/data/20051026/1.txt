World Business Briefing | Americas: Canada: A U.S. Court Date on BlackBerry
In response to a request from Research in Motion, the Canadian company that provides BlackBerry wireless service, the United States Supreme Court gave NTP, a patent holding company, until Wednesday to show why the wireless service should be shut down in the United States. An American appeals court recently upheld a patent infringement case NTP brought against R.I.M., and NTP plans to ask a lower court to activate an injunction it was granted two years ago against BlackBerry service; that injunction was suspended pending appeal. R.I.M. has said it will ask to have a $450 million settlement the two companies reached earlier this year enforced by the court. That deal fell apart as the companies were negotiating final terms.
