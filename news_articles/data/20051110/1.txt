Setback in Court for BlackBerry Maker
A federal judge in Virginia said Wednesday that it was ''highly unlikely'' he would delay a patent case against the maker of the BlackBerry wireless e-mail device that could result in a ban on its use in the United States. The company, Research In Motion, based in Waterloo, Ontario, requested the delay until the United States Patent and Trademark Office re-examines patents held by NTP, based in Arlington, Va. Three years ago, NTP successfully sued R.I.M., contending patent infringement. That award was held up to permit R.I.M.'s ultimately unsuccessful appeal.
