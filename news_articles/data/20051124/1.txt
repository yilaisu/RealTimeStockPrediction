BlackBerry Maker Lowers Subscriber Forecast
Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry phones and pagers, lowered its forecast for new subscribers yesterday as product releases are delayed and a lawsuit threatens to shut its service. Subscriber growth will be 8 percent less than the 680,000 to 710,000 new users the company expected this quarter, Research in Motion said. The company, which is based in Waterloo, Ontario, reiterated its forecast that third-quarter revenue would be $540 million to $570 million.
