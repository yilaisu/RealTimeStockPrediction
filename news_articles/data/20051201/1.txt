BlackBerry Patent Case Is Nearer Showdown
Research In Motion moved closer Wednesday to a showdown with NTP, a patent holding company, over BlackBerry service after a court dismissed its request to impose a failed settlement agreement on the two companies. The ruling by Judge James R. Spencer of Federal District Court in Richmond, Va., means R.I.M. will either have to renegotiate a settlement with NTP or face a shutdown of its BlackBerry wireless e-mail service in the United States, perhaps within the next month.
Research In Motion moves closer to showdown with NTP, patent holding company, over BlackBerry service after Federal Judge James R Spencer dismisses its request to impose failed settlement agreement on two companies; ruling means Research In Motion will either have to renegotiate settlement with NTP or face shutdown of its BlackBerry wireless e-mail service in US, perhaps within next month; estimated 70 percent of Research's revenue from 3.65 million BlackBerry users worldwide comes from US; most analysts say shutdown is unlikely because of enormous financial damage it would do to company; Research says it can substitute alternate, user-tested technology that does not violate NTP's patents if shutdown does occur; photo (M)
