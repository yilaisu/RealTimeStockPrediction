Ruling for Maker Of BlackBerry
Research in Motion won a second ruling yesterday from the United States Patent and Trademark Office over one of the patents at the center of a dispute over its BlackBerry wireless e-mail device. NTP, a patent holding company based in Arlington, Va., contends that Research in Motion, based in Waterloo, Ontario, infringed on its patents for technology used in the BlackBerry. The patent office issued what it called a nonfinal action yesterday, saying that one of the five patents owned by NTP is invalid. Still pending is a reconsideration of another patent that was found to be infringed by Research in Motion.
