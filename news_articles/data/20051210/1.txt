Settlement Rejected In BlackBerry Case
The patent holding company NTP Inc. has rejected an offer by Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry e-mail device, to settle their patent dispute and the two sides are not currently negotiating, NTP's co-founder, Don Stout, said Friday. Mr. Stout said Research In Motion had made an ''unacceptable'' written offer Thursday to settle their patent infringement case, a lawsuit that could shut down the popular BlackBerry e-mail service in the United States.
