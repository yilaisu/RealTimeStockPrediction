Profit Jumps at BlackBerry Maker Despite Legal Woes
The legal uncertainty surrounding the BlackBerry e-mail service appeared to have no financial impact on its Canadian maker, Research In Motion, in the third quarter. The company reported on Wednesday that profit rose 33 percent, to $120.1 million, while revenue grew 53 percent, to $560.6 million, compared with a year ago. But growing customer uncertainty stemming from a patent infringement lawsuit that might lead to a shutdown of most BlackBerry service in the United States caused R.I.M to lower its expectations for growth. It now expects to attract 700,000 to 750,000 new BlackBerry users in the current quarter, down from an earlier estimate of up to 825,000.
