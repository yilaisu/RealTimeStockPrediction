Patent Rejected For BlackBerry
Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry wireless e-mail device, said yesterday that the United States Patent and Trademark Office had issued preliminary rejections of two wireless e-mail patents owned by NTP, the holding company that had won a patent infringement lawsuit against it. Both patents were also rejected in earlier rulings.
