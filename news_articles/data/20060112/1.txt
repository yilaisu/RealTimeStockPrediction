A Samsung Phone Hopes To Give the BlackBerry A Run for Your Money
Samsung's latest smart phone, the SCH-i830, is an ambitious attempt to kick Research in Motion's BlackBerry out of the limelight. The phone -- with the Windows Mobile 2003 Pocket PC operating system and a tiny keyboard -- lets travelers work at home or abroad with aplomb. The SCH-i830 will be available from Verizon later this month for $600 with a two-year service agreement. It also supports quad-band G.S.M. service, allowing you to pick up a prepaid SIM card anywhere in the world and keep talking without incurring roaming charges.
