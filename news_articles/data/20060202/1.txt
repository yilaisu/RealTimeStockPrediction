Ruling Aids Manufacturer Of BlackBerry
A preliminary ruling by the United States patent office on Wednesday further undermined legal claims by a company that has sought to shut the BlackBerry wireless e-mail device in the United States. Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry, said the decision meant that the patent office had twice rejected all five patents controlled by NTP that are related to BlackBerry litigation. NTP is an intellectual property company based in Arlington, Va.
