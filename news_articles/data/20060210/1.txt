BlackBerry Maker Promises To Offer Backup Gear Soon
Research in Motion said Thursday that it would soon release backup software that would keep its BlackBerry wireless e-mail service working even if a federal court shuts down the current system. The announcement comes two weeks before a federal district court in Richmond, Va., will begin hearings on a request by NTP, a patent-holding company in Arlington, Va., to ban the sale and use of most BlackBerries in the United States. The ban would apply to everyone except government and emergency workers.
