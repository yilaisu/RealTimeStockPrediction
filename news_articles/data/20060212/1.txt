A Chill at the Specter of BlackBerry Winter
THE route of most technology is from ''Why would anyone need that?'' to ''How did I ever live without it?'' When Tom Cruise used a cordless phone in ''Risky Business,'' I remember thinking the device was a gimmick. When the first fax machine was installed near my desk in the newsroom (one machine, back then, for hundreds of reporters), I thought, ''Don't messenger services deliver clearer copies?'' And I was more than a little skeptical (not to mention spooked) when I first heard a car talk and give the driver directions. I am now a huge fan of all these things. That is why I am watching, with a mix of anthropological fascination and sympathetic dread, the possibility that, for the first time, the trend of technology might be reversed. If a court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in a patent lawsuit later this month, all our BlackBerry technology might go dark.
