Judge Won't Hold BlackBerry Hearing
A federal judge in Virginia yesterday refused the United States government's request to hold a hearing on how a proposed shutdown of BlackBerry service would work. The government, which would be exempt from a shutdown, asked Federal District Judge James R. Spencer to hear testimony and gather evidence to show that functions like communications with federal contractors would not be impaired. The BlackBerry's 3.2 million users in the United States include Wall Street executives and members of Congress.
