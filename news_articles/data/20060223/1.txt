Patent Ruling May Help BlackBerry Maker
The efforts by Research in Motion to avoid a shutdown of its BlackBerry wireless e-mail service in the United States received support yesterday from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The agency issued a final rejection of a patent that a jury found had been infringed upon by Research in Motion, which makes the BlackBerry. The patent owner, NTP Inc. of Arlington, Va., can appeal the rejection to a patent office board, then to a court. Earlier this month, the office issued what amounted to a final rejection of a second patent.
