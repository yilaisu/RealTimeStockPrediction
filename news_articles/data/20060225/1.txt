Judge Lets BlackBerry Stay in Play For Now
Owners of BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices can continue to use them, at least for now. A federal judge Friday declined to immediately stop the service, which is at the heart of a long-running patent dispute. That gave another reprieve to the company that makes the BlackBerry, Research in Motion, and its estimated 3.2 million customers in the United States.
Judge James R Spencer rules that he will not immediately stop BlackBerry wireless e-mail service at heart of long-running patent dispute; says he is surprised and disappointed that Research in Motion and NTP have not been able to reach settlement; judge gives no timetable as to when he will issue injunction; United States Patent and Trademark Office has found all three of NTP patents related to case invalid; NTP says it will appeal; photo (M)
