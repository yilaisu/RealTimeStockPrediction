E-Mail in Hand, and No BlackBerry in Sight
Research in Motion and its popular BlackBerry are out of dire legal straits, but that's no reason to ignore the range of other hand-held devices for sending and receiving e-mail. Consider the Motorola Q, a Windows Mobile cellphone with a full keyboard and a bright 2.4-inch color screen. The Q will be one of the thinnest smartphones on the market when it comes out in a few weeks (a service provider and price have not yet been announced).
