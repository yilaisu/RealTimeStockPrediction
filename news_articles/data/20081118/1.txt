Turn the BlackBerry Into a Remote Control
When Apple introduced its iPhone 3G and 2.0 operating system last summer, it also released a free app called Remote. With it, users can turn their iPhone or iPod Touch into a remote control to play music from their iTunes library and videos stored on an Apple TV device.
A BlackBerry can be a remote control. You just have to ask yourself why.
