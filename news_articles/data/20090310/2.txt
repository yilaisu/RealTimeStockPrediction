MetroPCS Beckons BlackBerry Fans With Curve
While writing about the growing popularity of prepaid phones, I encountered many cellphone customers, still bound under contracts with a major wireless carrier, who said they were willing to sacrifice the bragging rights of owning a fancier device in favor of cutting costs and living with the simpler phones that tend to accompany prepaid plans.
MetroPCS, a prepaid cellphone carrier, announced that it will begin offering the BlackBerry Curve to customers under its $50-a-month, unlimited voice-and-data plan.
