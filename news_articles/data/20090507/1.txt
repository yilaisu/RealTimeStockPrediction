BlackBerry Throws a Curve At the Apple iPhone
The iPhone lost its spot as top-selling smartphone to the BlackBerry Curve in the first quarter of 2009, but that doesn't necessarily spell the end of the iPhone's market dominance, said Ross Rubin, an analyst with the NPD Group, a research firm. According to an NPD survey, the five top-selling smartphones from Jan. 1 to March 31 were the BlackBerry Curve, the Apple iPhone 3G, the BlackBerry Storm, the BlackBerry Pearl (not including the Pearl Flip) and the T-Mobile G1 using the Android operating system.
