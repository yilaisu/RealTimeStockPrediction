R.I.M. Woos BlackBerry App Developers
BlackBerry owners may be able to type circles around their iPhone-toting friends when it comes to speeding through e-mails. But when the work is over and it's time to play with the latest useful or silly applications, their speedy thumbs have nowhere to go. By the latest count, the Apple iPhone has 100,000 apps and the BlackBerry has just a few thousand.
The company that makes the BlackBerry is trying to compete with Apple and its iPhone by making it easier for application developers to program for the BlackBerry and make money through advertising and fees.
