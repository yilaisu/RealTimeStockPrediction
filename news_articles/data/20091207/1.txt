Making a List, Checking It Twice: BlackBerry or iPhone?
'Tis the season for giving, and as C.E.O. and Santa at my company I've made a list of must-have items for my firm. I've identified a couple of key categories and narrowed the possibilities to two choices in each. I now turn to the collective wisdom and experience of fellow small-business owners. First, a smartphone.
I can no longer afford to be without mobile access to several of the applications on my laptop, including the obvious: contacts, calendar, e-mail and Internet.
