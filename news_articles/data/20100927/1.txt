Gadgetwise: BlackBerry Tablet Revealed â€“ The PlayBook
At Research In Motion's Web-developer conference on Monday in San Francisco, the company revealed its tablet, called the PlayBook. The 9.7mm-thick tablet has a seven-inch display, front and rear HD cameras, and full 1080p support along with H.D.M.I. output. The PlayBook has no cellular connection of its own: it works in concert with a BlackBerry hand-held, using an encrypted Bluetooth connection to tether to the phone.
Mike Lazaridis, R.I.M. co-chief executive, did not give any price or availability information about a tablet that can be tethered to the BlackBerry.
