U.A.E. Says BlackBerry Dispute Is Resolved
The United Arab Emirates backed off a threat to cut crucial services on BlackBerry smart phones Friday, just days before the ban on the device made by Research in Motion was set to take effect, The Associated Press reports.
The United Arab Emirates will not suspend BlackBerry services on Monday after resolving a dispute with its Canadian maker, Research in Motion, over access to e-mail and other data.
