Sleeker Look For BlackBerry
Research In Motion, the company behind the BlackBerry, was once considered the leader in mobile phone technology, creating devices that changed the business world. Yet the company has never won much praise for the design and feel of its phones. It may be hoping that will change with its acquisition of the Astonishing Tribe, an interface and design company, which it announced on the R.I.M. blog last week. David Yach, chief technology officer at R.I.M., boasted of the Astonishing Tribe's design prowess in the blog post, saying the smaller company would help with the design and development of R.I.M.'s smartphones.
