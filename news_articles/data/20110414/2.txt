Review of Reviews: The BlackBerry PlayBook
After its long-awaited arrival, Research In Motion's BlackBerry tablet is finally making its debut to the world. (You can find a wide selection of reviews and commentary here.) This slick new tablet, which is officially called the PlayBook, sports a seven-inch touch-screen, weighs 0.9 pounds and costs between $500 and $700, depending on memory capacity.
The reviews are in on the BlackBerry PlayBook and while critics like the hardware, overall, they have not been kind to the new tablet.
